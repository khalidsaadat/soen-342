## :hourglass:Description
Currently, students and parents find it very difficult to connect with a tutor that will provide them quality lessons which will enhance their educational experience. As full time students ourselves, we found it very difficult to find competent tutors online since most online tutoring hubs are not well managed and lack tutors from various academic backgrounds. Hence, the development of an E-academy platform to connect tutors, students and parents is vital. 

## :bulb:Objective
The objective of this project is to build and implement a system where students, parents and credible tutors can connect in order to book one-on-one and group tutoring sessions. Our system will include various features that will ease the difficult process of finding a suitable student and tutor match. This repository will be used to gather all relevant information regarding our platform. This includes the information about the teammates, entire code for the platform, sprints following the requirement elicitation techniques as well as any other important documents.
